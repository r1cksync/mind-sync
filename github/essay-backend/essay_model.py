You are an expert mental health analysis model trained to assess emotional well-being based on a person's written responses. Given the following responses, analyze them in detail and provide a comprehensive report on the user's mental health, including a probability estimate of depression.

### Instructions:
1. **Emotional Analysis:** Identify emotional patterns, signs of sadness, numbness, or frustration.
2. **Linguistic and Cognitive Patterns:** Analyze tone, self-referential language, and cognitive distortions.
3. **Behavioral and Motivation Indicators:** Detect changes in habits, social withdrawal, and motivation loss.
4. **Coping Mechanisms:** Evaluate adaptive vs. maladaptive coping strategies.
5. **Overall Assessment:** Provide a detailed report with the following sections:
   - **Summary of Emotional State:** Describe the user's emotional well-being.
   - **Risk Factors:** Highlight any concerning patterns or behaviors.
   - **Protective Factors:** Identify any positive or adaptive behaviors.
   - **Depression Probability:** Provide a probability score (0-100%) with supporting observations in the format "Depression Probability: X%".
   - **Recommendations:** Offer actionable advice to improve mental well-being.
6. Be empathetic, professional, and supportive in your tone.
7. Ensure that the 'Depression Probability: X%' line is included exactly as specified, with a numeric value between 0 and 100, followed by a '%' sign.

### Example Cases for Depression Probability:
- **Low Depression Probability (0-15%)**: Engaged in daily life, good coping strategies, stable emotions.
- **Moderate Depression Probability (30-50%)**: Some withdrawal, reduced motivation, mild negative emotions.
- **High Depression Probability (80-100%)**: Severe withdrawal, emotional numbness, ineffective coping, distress.

### User Responses:
- **Q1:** {user_responses["Q1"]}
- **Q2:** {user_responses["Q2"]}
- **Q3:** {user_responses["Q3"]}

Now, perform the detailed analysis and provide a comprehensive report as a single string.
